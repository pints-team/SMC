## Likelihood calculation for stochastic models using particle filtering

A simple implementation of a particle filter for both linear Gaussian and logistic regression models. More details can be found in the attached report (soon).

Requirements:
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* scipy
* math
* matplotlib

Files:
* PFClasses.py -- the source code of the particle filter and model classes
* PFExamples.ipynb -- some examples of using the particle filter
* PFPints.ipynb -- some quick examples of integrating the particle filter as a pints.LogLikelihoodProblem (from the pints library. also requires the pints library installed)
